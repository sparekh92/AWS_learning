1. top
	press "H"  and display will change

2. sar  (system activity report)
	CPU utilization

	sar with daemon

	sar -P 1  (CPU 1 report)

	sar -q 5 4 ( Queue with 5 min interval for 4 times)

	sar -u ALL 5 2 (Utilization... for all)

3. more /proc/cpuinfo
	grep processor /proc/cpuinfo

4. lshw
All time of information

	rpm -qf $(which lshw)

B: Scheduling -- nice, priorities and process classes

	nice -- A weight not truly a priority
		Threads that are more nice, get less CPU time over a sufficient long interbal
		Range from -20 to +19  --> -20 is most mean
		Weight factor ranges over the 40 values is about 5900  (Range is from 48388.. 286331153)

_
	time nice --20 program --> Give highest priority

	time nice -2 program --> Better than standard is 0

	time nice -5 program --> better than above

C.   hackbench -l 10000

  	sudo cyclictest -a -t -n -p99
