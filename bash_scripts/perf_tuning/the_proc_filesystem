1. PROC is "pseudo" file system

	PROC files provides kernel info

	The length reported by ls may be zero it's a pseudo filesystem

	>2000 proc files 
		Eg: /proc/1234 would be information about process with PID 1234
		Inside Process Proc files  
			limits (ulimit will read data from here) and numa_maps
			Also provides "stat --> general status info" 
			statm --> Process memory status info
			status	--> Similar to ps info
				Eg:  FOr "bash" prompt
					echo $$
					cd /proc/$$
					cat stat
					more ststm
					more status  --> Humon readable format

	PROC files under /proc/sys represent kernel variables
		Some are RW, some R and some W
	
	The proc filesystems needs to be mounted
		This happens automatically at boot time
		mount -t proc proc /proc
        PROC files/directries have permission modes like other files and directories --> some files are writables by root

	Commmand to change parameters are "sysctl"
	sysctl -a   --> to list all availale parameter

	/etc/sysctl.conf   or  /etc/sysctl.d   --> System config files  for permanent change

	Several subdirectoris under /proc/sys
		> abi, debug, dev, fs, fscache, kernel, net, sunrpc, vm
